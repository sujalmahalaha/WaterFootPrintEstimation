# AquaMeter - Calculate Your Water Footprint 🌍💧

Aquameter is a web application that utilizes image processing to estimate the water footprint of objects. Simply upload or capture an image of an item, and EcoLens will provide insights into the virtual water consumption associated with that object.

## How it Works

1. **Image Capture:** Upload an image or take a photo of the object you want to assess.
2. **Image Processing:** Advanced algorithms analyze and identify features in the image.
3. **Water Footprint Calculation:** Based on the identified features, EcoLens estimates the water footprint.
